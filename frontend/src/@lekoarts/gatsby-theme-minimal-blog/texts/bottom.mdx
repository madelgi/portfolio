My development activity over the past couple months.

  *technologies: flask, python, docker, boto3, prefect, neo4j, ecs/fargate*

  My current day job (but also a personal project). I am the lead engineer, and I am responsible for
  most back end work. In practice, that means mostly data engineering and modeling, with
  a little bit of API design mixed in. The code is not open-sourced for intellectual property-related
  reasons, but feel free to click around the site. It is an early-stage prototype, so be aware that
  there may be periods of non-responsiveness.

  *technologies: flask, python, docker, redis/rq*

  Essentially a job queue API -- allows users to register, define "arbitary" scripts attached to their
  account, and run those scripts in isolated docker containers. I started this as a toy project, but
  I plan on continuing development over the next few weeks.

- **prefect | contributor** <Link style={{float: 'right'}} key="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amadelgi" href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amadelgi">prs</Link><Br/><Br />
  *technologies: python, boto3*

  Prefect is a workflow management system used extensively at DocOne. I have made significant conributions to
  the task library, particularly the AWS functionality, and I have also added an additional back end storage option
  for GitLab.

  *technologies: gatsby, react, docker*

  This is still in its infancy, but working with gatsby and react has been a pleasure, and I hope to create some
  basic extensions to the functionality here. Maybe a photo gallery or a more sensible project/contributions
  page. There are some minor design modifications I plan on making as well, like collapsing the external links on the
  right side of the header (i.e., Github, LinkedIn, etc) on small displays.
