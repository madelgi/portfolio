I have been working as a software developer for roughly the past ~7 years, although I spent two of those years
seeing if a graduate program in computer science was right for me (it wasn't, I left early with my master's degree).
After leaving grad school, I went to work full-time at the medical start-up DocOne, where I was responsible for
most of the back end and data science portions of the stack. Now I work at real-estate tech company <a href="https://www.zumper.com">Zumper</a>, 
primarily as a back end developer, though I still occasionally do data engineering work as. Please feel free 
to reach out via <a href = "mailto: maxdelgiudice@gmail.com">email</a> with anything you'd like to share.
