I have been working as a software developer for roughly the past ~5 years, although I spent two of those years
seeing if a graduate program in computer science was right for me (it wasn't, I left early with my master's degree).
After leaving grad school, I went to work full-time at my current start-up, DocOne, where I am responsible for
most of the back end and data science portions of the stack. Please feel free to reach out
via <a href = "mailto: maxdelgiudice@gmail.com">email</a> with anything you'd like to share.
