After using it so much in college and grad school, I developed a soft spot in my heart for LaTeX, and
although I'm no longer in academia, I continue to use it to typeset my resume. In the year 2020,
are there alternatives that can prepare a nicely formatted resume with less hassle? Sure. Is all of this
a waste of time? Maybe a little bit. But it looks really nice, and I've been using it for over 10 years,
so why change now.


## The problem

I have a habit of creating personal websites for myself and never updating the content. I
realized that if I want to have a functioning, accurate website, the process of updating these
components must be as seamless as possible. A simple place to start is keeping my resume updated. I
typically host a PDF of my resume on my site, and then it immediately becomes stagnant when I make
a change to the content. I just cannot bring myself to copy the updated PDF to whatever server is hosting
my website in a timely manner. No big deal if I just change a word or two, but after six months, the
resume copy on my website ultimately becomes stale and inaccurate.


## The solution

I typically use Overleaf to edit my resume, and I recently noticed they have the option to sync your
content with a number of external services -- Dropbox, GitHub, etc. The Dropbox integration requires
a premium account, but the GitHub integration is free. I have been meaning to experiment with GitHub
Actions over the past couple of months, and this seemed like the perfect, low-stakes environment to
try them out. I figured the basic flow would be something like this:

```
Overleaf ---> GitHub ---- [SOME ACTION] -----> Updated website
```

As I mentioned earlier, the first part of this pipeline is provided for us by the developers at Overleaf,
so let's figure out what `[SOME ACTION]` is, exactly.

To start, Overleaf syncs with Github by creating a repo under your account with the source TeX files (e.g.,
`.cls`, `.tex`,  etc). From there, whenever you make changes via Overleaf, it pushes those changes to the
GitHub repo's master branch, and if you make changes via GitHub or locally, you can pull those into Overleaf.
For a single person editing a document, it works fine. So now, there are two problems to solve:

1. The GitHub repo contains source files, but not a compiled PDF. How do we automatically generate this PDF from source?
2. Once the PDF is generated, where should we put it so that the website is immediately updated?

Let's start by addressing the first issue.

### Using GitHub Actions to compile LaTeX

Actions are defined via `.yml` files stored in a `.github/workflows` directory that you keep in your repo.
To understand them, I think it's useful to just jump into the code. Here's an action that compiles my source
LaTeX files into a PDF whenever I push to master:

```yaml
name: Build TeX CD

on:
    push:
        branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build_latex:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Set up Git repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Compile LaTeX document
        uses: xu-cheng/latex-action@v2
        with:
          root_file: cv_4.tex

```

The first part of the file, under the `on` key, is a trigger: when should the action run? It specifies that the action
should run whenever I push changes to master. The actual logic behind the job is under the `jobs:build_latex` key. Here's
the breakdown of the keys underneath:

- `runs-on`: This specifies the virtual environment in which the job runs. In this case, we are running our action on an
   Ubuntu environment. This environment is hosted by Github, but you can specify your own action runner here as well.
- `steps`: These are the sequence of tasks that define the job
    - `name`: This is the name that displays for this step on Github (you can view your logging for your actions as they run)
    - `uses`: While an action can basically be any arbitrary chunk of code, the community has thousands of prewritten actions
       to choose from. For the first step, we use the `checkout` action, which checks-out your code from the current workspace,
       so later steps in the workflow can access it. The second step uses the `latex-action` to compile our raw tex file into
       a PDF.
    - `with`: The `with` key passes in arguments to an action. In our case, the `latex-action` requires a `root_file`, i.e.,
       which file(s) in the repository should we compile to PDFs? In this case, my resume is titled `cv_4.tex`, so I pass that
       as an argument.

The above example illustrates how straightforward it is to define an action. It's essentially just a configuration file that
defines a series of executable steps. Frequently, the Github community will already have a prewritten action for you to use,
in which case executing that action is as simple as referencing the community script, and supplying arguments (if needed).
However, if that's not the case, you can write your own reusable action in a language of your choice.

Returning to our actual goal, let's discuss what we've done: after committing the `.yml` file to the repo, we push our
changes to master, the steps run successfully, and...nothing really happens. So far, what we've written checks out
the code in our github workspace, and then compiles our source TeX files into a PDF. This PDF lives in our virtual
environment, and it only exists during the lifetime of our action. We need one final step to actually place the resume
in a location accessible by the web server.


### Using GitHub Actions to upload a file to S3

To wrap this all up, let's add one final step to upload the generated PDF to an S3 bucket.
Doing this requires discussing one more Actions-related topic: secrets. Github makes it easy to store
credentials that you can reference in your workflows. I am going to use the S3 cp command to move my
resume PDF into my S3 bucket -- this requires credentials. To add a secret to your workflow,
use the `Settings > Secrets` tab on your GitHub repo. After doing so, you can reference the secret in your
Actions script similar to how you would use an environment variable, with the following syntax: `${{ secrets.MY_BIG_SECRET }}`.

After adding my S3 key and secret, I can add the following step to my script:


```yaml
name: Build TeX CD

on:
    push:
        branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build_latex:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Set up Git repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Compile LaTeX document
        uses: xu-cheng/latex-action@v2
        with:
          root_file: cv_4.tex
      - name: Upload to S3
        uses: tpaschalis/s3-sync-action@master
        with:
            args: --acl public-read
        env:
            FILE: ./cv_4.pdf
            AWS_REGION: us-west-2
            AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.AWS_BUCKET }}
            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_KEY }}
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET }}

```

We use a preexisting S3 copy action, pass in the relevant arguments, and upload
the file to S3. That completes the pipeline -- whenever I push a change to master, either
locally or via Overleaf's "Sync to GitHub" button, GitHub will take care of building a
PDF and uploading it to S3. Simply make sure the S3 Key is publicly accessible, place it
in the appropriate location in your website code, and you're good to go!


## Closing thoughts and next steps

The above `.yml` file is about 25 lines, and it builds and subsequently "deploys" (in a sense) my updated
resume to an S3 bucket. This is pretty cool, and it gets me a little bit closer to having a website that
I actually maintain. For the next post, I will use actions to set up a genuine CD pipeline for the
website code itself, so I can seamlessly deploy styling changes, content updates, etc.
